Introducing [Asgard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgard), my Emacs setup that allows me to feel like a god when I'm coding. 
That is, in case you are wondering, the reason behind the name :)

Before proceding, you might want to backup your current Emacs configuration. 
To make your Emacs worthy of becoming an Asgardian you just need to do this:

    cd ~/
    git clone git@github.com:JoaoVasques/asgard.d.git .emacs.d
    
This setup of optimized for Mac OS. Feel free to contribute with new packages and configurations that you like.

Welcome to the realm!
